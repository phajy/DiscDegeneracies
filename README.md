# Disc Degeneracies

Investigating degeneracies with more realistic disc models.

## Plan

- Create simple disc models consisting of a power law plus iron line for a range of parameters including spin, Edddington ratio, corona height, inclination, etc.
- Simulate *Athena* data with a range of S/N ratios (start with relatively high quality data, e.g., with 100,000 counts)
- Fit "standard" models to these simulated data to see how well the parameters can be recovered

## Extensions to plan

- Allow the spacetime to vary, e.g., non-Kerr models
- Convolve iron line with full reflection spectrum
